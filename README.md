My latest project is called `google_sheets_write` and it uses Python. It is a personal accounting software that uses the Google API to search for data in emails and then writes that data into a Google Sheet.

- 🔍 Utilizes Google API to search data in emails.
- 📝 Writes the extracted data into Google Sheets for easy tracking and managem

Also you can check my personal accounting REST API that uses NestJS and TypeORM. [nestJSpvp](https://github.com/digbot/nestJSpvp)
